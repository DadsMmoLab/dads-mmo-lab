# Yu'lon Checklist

> Companion to `pyplan/roadmap.md`. This file is where **checkable progress** is tracked, while `roadmap.md` itself stays a clean plan with no commentary (style-guide §9).
>
> **How to use this file:**
> - Check items off as they're completed. Leave unchecked items as-is; don't delete steps even if scope changes — note the change instead.
> - This file is expected to grow throughout the project. That's fine; it's a checklist, not a plan.

## Phase 0 — Tooling & hygiene

- [x] 0.1 Pin the toolchain (`requirements-dev.txt`: pytest, mypy, black, ruff)
- [x] 0.2 Add a CI lint/type/test job (`ci.yml`, separate from `release.yml`)
- [x] 0.3 Resolve remaining naming debt (lowercase filenames, valid `snake_case` package dirs)
- [x] 0.4 Pin an AzerothCore compose fixture for integration tests
- [x] 0.5 Write a minimal contributor/dev-setup doc (`development.md`)
- [x] 0.6 Establish a shared logging convention

---

## Phase 1 — Foundation (testable Python core, no UI)

- [x] 1.1 `runner.py` — subprocess streaming (`stream()`, `run()`)
- [x] 1.2 `platform.py` — OS detection + `config_dir()` + provisioning stubs
- [x] 1.3 `docker.py` — shared Docker lifecycle logic + port-conflict check
- [x] 1.4 Base controller abstraction
- [x] 1.5 Tests (mocked unit tests + real-Docker integration suite)
- [x] **Phase 1 exit criteria met** (live AzerothCore run passed 2026-08-20 — see Cross-cutting)

---

## Phase 2 — Manifest schema & data port

- [x] 2.1 Finalize the manifest schema (+ `repo` allow-list validation)
- [x] 2.2 Port WotLK modules from `wow-manage.sh` into `manifests/wow-wotlk/`
- [x] 2.3 `modules.py` — load/validate/fetch
- [x] **Phase 2 exit criteria met** (41 manifests + 4 indexes validate in CI; adding a module is a JSON file and an index entry, no Python)

---

## Phase 3 — Catalog (catalog + installer)

- [x] 3.1 `catalog.json` — game list
- [x] 3.2 `installer.py` — orchestration (Phase 3a: shells out to existing scripts) — **live Linux run passed 2026-08-21 on a fresh Ubuntu 24.04 VM (see Cross-cutting → Phase 3 live gate)**
- [x] 3.3 Silent Docker/WSL provisioning stubs wired in (graceful failure until Phase 5)
- [x] 3.4 Networking auto-setup (LAN + internet play; firewall helpers, realmlist updater, router-step prompts) — README §13
- [x] **Phase 3 exit criteria met** (verified via CLI/test harness — no UI yet): `python -m yulon.catalog.installer wow-wotlk --server-dir ~/wow-server-playerbots` on a fresh Ubuntu 24.04 VM (12 vCPU, Docker provided by `ensure_docker()`) answered every prompt, built AzerothCore + playerbots (~11 min compile), and ended with `install of wow-wotlk finished` and all three containers up (2026-08-21 00:27)

---

## Phase 4 — Controller UI (PySide6)

- [x] 4.1 `log_panel.py` — streaming output widget
- [x] 4.2 `catalog_view.py` — browsable catalog
- [x] 4.3 `controller_view.py` — per-install management (+ LAN/internet networking auto-setup control)
- [x] **Phase 4 exit criteria met** — human click-through against a live server on the Ubuntu 24.04 VM, 2026-08-21 (see Cross-cutting → Phase 4 click-through)

---

## Phase 5 — Windows/macOS provisioning + packaging

- [x] 5.1 Silent Docker Desktop / WSL2 provisioning + doc update — Linux path verified for real on a fresh Ubuntu 24.04 VM (2026-08-20); the Windows detection/short-circuit/plan paths verified on a real Windows 11 box (2026-08-21). The silent Docker Desktop **install** itself is still unverified (both test machines already had Docker), and macOS has no machine at all — see Cross-cutting.
- [x] 5.2 PyInstaller specs finalized (local `pyinstaller build/pylauncher.spec` builds `build/dist/yulon/`; bundles manifests/, catalog.json and the install scripts; `YULON_SMOKE_TEST=1` runs the frozen exe headless)
- [x] 5.3 GitHub Actions release matrix complete — `ci.yml` + `release.yml` now live at the repo root `.github/workflows/` (2026-08-21), which is the only path GitHub reads; both run with `working-directory: pylauncher`. Neither upstream branch had a root `.github/`, so nothing was overwritten. The release job still only proves itself on a `v*` tag.
- [x] 5.4 Application self-update check (README §10)
- [ ] **Phase 5 exit criteria met** — `ci.yml` is green on GitHub for the first time (2026-08-21, run 32432706579); `release.yml` has never run: `workflow_dispatch` only works from a repository's default branch (the fork's is `rust-main`, which does not carry the file), and the only other trigger is a `v*` tag, which publishes a Release. One tag push proves the three artifacts.

---

## Phase 6 — Cross-platform install paths (macOS + native Windows)

- [ ] 6.0 Rehome the install scripts (move `archive/guides/<game>/install-*.sh` + `dml-start.sh`/`wow-manage.sh` into `catalog/installers/<game>/`; update `catalog.json`, `pylauncher.spec` `script_globs`, and the path-pinning tests)
    - Update scripts and manifests to use proper.
- [ ] 6.1 Honest platform gating (`catalog.json` per-entry platform support; refuse off-Linux installs with a clear message; surface the script's real output in the failed dialog)
- [ ] 6.2 macOS install path (macOS variant / shared reimplementation driving `docker compose` against Docker Desktop; wire into `catalog.json` script resolution)
- [ ] 6.3 Native Windows install path (run inside a provisioned WSL2 distro or a Windows-native equivalent; `[blocked]` on 6.2)
- [ ] 6.4 Tests & gates (mocked platform-gating + script-resolution tests; live-gate on real macOS and Windows 11)
- [ ] **Phase 6 exit criteria met** — all four v1 servers install end-to-end on Linux, macOS, and native Windows; off-Linux clicks never silently fast-fail
