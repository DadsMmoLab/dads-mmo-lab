# Yu'lon Checklist

> Companion to `pyplan/roadmap.md`. This file is where **checkable progress** is tracked, while `roadmap.md` itself stays a clean plan with no commentary (style-guide §9).
>
> **How to use this file:**
> - Check items off as they're completed. Leave unchecked items as-is; don't delete steps even if scope changes — note the change instead.
> - This file is expected to grow throughout the project. That's fine; it's a checklist, not a plan.

---

## Phase 0 — Tooling & hygiene

- [x] 0.1 Pin the toolchain (`requirements-dev.txt`: pytest, mypy, black, ruff)
- [x] 0.2 Add a CI lint/type/test job (`ci.yml`, separate from `release.yml`)
- [x] 0.3 Resolve remaining naming debt (lowercase filenames, valid `snake_case` package dirs)
- [x] 0.4 Pin an AzerothCore compose fixture for integration tests
- [x] 0.5 Write a minimal contributor/dev-setup doc (`development.md`)
- [x] 0.6 Establish a shared logging convention

---

## Phase 1 — Foundation (testable Python core, no UI)

- [x] 1.1 `runner.py` — subprocess streaming (`stream()`, `run()`)
- [x] 1.2 `platform.py` — OS detection + `config_dir()` + provisioning stubs
- [x] 1.3 `docker.py` — shared Docker lifecycle logic + port-conflict check
- [x] 1.4 Base controller abstraction
- [x] 1.5 Tests (mocked unit tests + real-Docker integration suite)
- [x] **Phase 1 exit criteria met** (live AzerothCore run passed 2026-08-20 — see Cross-cutting)

---

## Phase 2 — Manifest schema & data port

- [x] 2.1 Finalize the manifest schema (+ `repo` allow-list validation)
- [x] 2.2 Port WotLK modules from `wow-manage.sh` into `manifests/wow-wotlk/`
- [x] 2.3 `modules.py` — load/validate/fetch
- [x] **Phase 2 exit criteria met** (41 manifests + 4 indexes validate in CI; adding a module is a JSON file and an index entry, no Python)

---

## Phase 3 — Catalog (catalog + installer)

- [x] 3.1 `catalog.json` — game list
- [x] 3.2 `installer.py` — orchestration (Phase 3a: shells out to existing scripts) — **live Linux run passed 2026-08-21 on a fresh Ubuntu 24.04 VM (see Cross-cutting → Phase 3 live gate)**
- [x] 3.3 Silent Docker/WSL provisioning stubs wired in (graceful failure until Phase 5)
- [x] 3.4 Networking auto-setup (LAN + internet play; firewall helpers, realmlist updater, router-step prompts) — README §13
- [x] **Phase 3 exit criteria met** (verified via CLI/test harness — no UI yet): `python -m yulon.catalog.installer wow-wotlk --server-dir ~/wow-server-playerbots` on a fresh Ubuntu 24.04 VM (12 vCPU, Docker provided by `ensure_docker()`) answered every prompt, built AzerothCore + playerbots (~11 min compile), and ended with `install of wow-wotlk finished` and all three containers up (2026-08-21 00:27)

---

## Phase 4 — Controller UI (PySide6)

- [x] 4.1 `log_panel.py` — streaming output widget
- [x] 4.2 `catalog_view.py` — browsable catalog
- [x] 4.3 `controller_view.py` — per-install management (+ LAN/internet networking auto-setup control)
- [x] **Phase 4 exit criteria met** — human click-through against a live server on the Ubuntu 24.04 VM, 2026-08-21 (see Cross-cutting → Phase 4 click-through)

---

## Phase 5 — Windows/macOS provisioning + packaging

- [x] 5.1 Silent Docker Desktop / WSL2 provisioning + doc update — Linux path verified for real on a fresh Ubuntu 24.04 VM (2026-08-20); the Windows detection/short-circuit/plan paths verified on a real Windows 11 box (2026-08-21). The silent Docker Desktop **install** itself is still unverified (both test machines already had Docker), and macOS has no machine at all — see Cross-cutting.
- [x] 5.2 PyInstaller specs finalized (local `pyinstaller build/pylauncher.spec` builds `build/dist/yulon/`; bundles manifests/, catalog.json and the install scripts; `YULON_SMOKE_TEST=1` runs the frozen exe headless)
- [x] 5.3 GitHub Actions release matrix complete — `ci.yml` + `release.yml` now live at the repo root `.github/workflows/` (2026-08-21), which is the only path GitHub reads; both run with `working-directory: pylauncher`. Neither upstream branch had a root `.github/`, so nothing was overwritten. The release job still only proves itself on a `v*` tag.
- [x] 5.4 Application self-update check (README §10)
- [x] **Phase 5 exit criteria met** (README §7: a push produces all three platform artifacts automatically) — proven 2026-08-21 by a throwaway `v*` tag on the fork: [run 32433417980](https://github.com/pjerra/dads-mmo-lab/actions/runs/32433417980), three runners green, artifacts `yulon-AppImage` (74 MB), `yulon-exe` (52 MB), `yulon-dmg` (42 MB), each also attached to the Release by `action-gh-release`; the tag and Release were deleted afterwards (they were a test), the run keeps its artifacts until 2026-11-19. The two artifacts we can run were then run — AppImage on Ubuntu 24.04, and the frozen `yulon.exe` out of the release zip on Windows 11 — both logging `window built, exiting 0`, which also makes 5.2 verified on real Windows from the shipped artifact rather than a local build. `ci.yml` is green on every push (run 32432706579). The `.dmg` is CI-built only — no Mac exists on this project, so it is unverified beyond building (Phase 6.5 item 9 covers it).

---

## Phase 6 — Cross-platform install paths (macOS + native Windows) — **WotLK only**

> **Scope gate:** Phase 6 targets WoW WotLK exclusively (6.0's script rehome may touch all four
> games mechanically, but 6.1–6.5's gating/installer/feature work is WotLK-only). TBC, Vanilla,
> and Tortoise are Phase 7 — not started until Phase 6's exit criteria are fully met.

- [x] 6.0 Rehome the install scripts — the eight executable files now live in `pylauncher/catalog/installers/<game>/` (parallel to `manifests/`), `catalog.json` paths are relative to that directory, `resources.installers_dir()` replaces `repo_root()`, `Installer(installers_root=…)` resolves them, and the spec ships the whole tree instead of globbing `archive/guides/**` — so the bundle no longer carries `archive/guides` at all (README §3a bonus). The Tortoise script was renamed to lowercase on the way (`install-tortoise-wow-wsl.sh`, style-guide §6a). Verified: 191 passed, and a frozen PyInstaller build contains all eight scripts under `catalog/installers/` and passes `YULON_SMOKE_TEST`. `archive/guides/` keeps the human-facing guides plus the four non-catalog installers (Maplestory, Mu Online, RuneScape, the Unbound addon), which no catalog entry references.
    - Update scripts and manifests to use proper systems and features.
- [x] 6.1 Honest platform gating — `install.platforms` is data in `catalog.json` (all four entries `["linux"]`), `Installer.preflight()` raises `UnsupportedPlatformError` with a user-readable message BEFORE any subprocess, the catalog tile disables Install with the reason on the tile ("Use existing…" stays enabled — managing a server works everywhere), `start_install()` refuses before the folder prompts, and a failed script's dialog now carries the script's own last 12 output lines ("It last said: …") instead of a bare exit status. Mocked through the `platform_id` seam per roadmap 6.4; 196 tests green.
- [ ] 6.2 macOS install path — **runtime is Docker Desktop** (macOS variant drives `docker compose` against the Docker Desktop the app provisions; no `pacman`/`systemctl`/`sudo`, no manual VM management)
- [ ] 6.3 Native Windows install path — **runtime is Docker Desktop** (drives `docker compose` against Docker Desktop's WSL2 backend; no bespoke WSL2/VM manager; `[blocked]` on 6.2)
- [ ] 6.4 Tests & gates (mocked platform-gating + script-resolution tests; live-gate on real macOS and Windows 11 — WotLK only)
- [ ] 6.5 Full WotLK feature coverage on Linux, macOS, and native Windows (the Phase 6 exit gate):
  - [ ] Install (zero shell interaction, all three platforms)
  - [ ] Server lifecycle: start/stop/status/health polling + README §12 port-conflict guard
  - [ ] Console: `docker attach` pty transport + full `CONTROLS-2.md` GM console (safe attach/detach, GM commands); Windows gap resolved or explicitly re-scoped (SOAP follow-up)
  - [ ] Account creation (`CREATE-ACCOUNTS.md`/`CONTROLS-1.md`): `account create` + `account set gmlevel`, no password echo, "already exists" handled, all three platforms
  - [ ] Maintenance (`CONTROLS-1.md`): cache clear, DB backup/restore, SQL changes — `maintenance.py` implemented (currently placeholder), rebuild/restart wiring done, all three platforms
  - [ ] Modules/mods: install/remove via the applier + rebuild/restart; manifest store GitHub refresh + bundled fallback
  - [ ] Networking auto-setup (README §13, full `WoW-Wotlk-NETWORKING.md` scope): firewall (ufw/firewalld/netsh + **macOS firewall designed/implemented**), WSL2 portproxy, LAN/public IP detection, realmlist updater + client writer, 0.0.0.0 binding check, CGNAT/DuckDNS/router-step prompts
  - [ ] Self-update check (README §10) — no platform-specific `config_dir()` issues
  - [ ] Packaging: live-gated against the packaged `.AppImage`/`.dmg`/`.exe`, not just `python main.py` from source
  - [ ] User-facing README topics (`pylauncher/README.md` + `archive/guides/wow-wotlk/README.md`) accurately reflect each platform's real state — no "works on macOS" claim before 6.2 is done
- [ ] **Phase 6 exit criteria met** — WoW WotLK has 100% working feature coverage (6.5) on Linux, macOS, and native Windows, zero shell interaction, no silent off-Linux fast-fail. **Phase 7 does not start until this is fully met.**

---

## Phase 7 — Full coverage for the remaining WoW servers (TBC, Vanilla, Tortoise)

> **[blocked]** on Phase 6's exit criteria. Same "100% working coverage on Linux, macOS, and
> native Windows" bar as Phase 6 — not a lesser bar. v1 scope remains these four servers only.

- [ ] 7.1 `controller_wow_tbc/` — full controller package + manifest port + 6.1–6.5 repeated for TBC on all three platforms
- [ ] 7.2 `controller_wow_vanilla/` — full controller package + 6.1–6.5 repeated for Vanilla on all three platforms
- [ ] 7.3 `controller_wow_tortoise/` — full controller package + 6.1–6.5 repeated for Tortoise on all three platforms; resolve the `status: wip`/unverified-client caveat, promote `catalog.json` status once verified
- [ ] 7.4 Cross-server regression pass — re-run WotLK's 6.5 coverage gate after 7.1–7.3 land to confirm shared layers (`docker.py`, base `Controller`, `runner.py`, `platform.py`, `networking.py`) weren't regressed
- [ ] **Phase 7 exit criteria met** — all four v1 servers (WotLK, TBC, Vanilla, Tortoise) have 100% working feature coverage on Linux, macOS, and native Windows. **Phase 8 does not start until this is fully met.**

---

## Phase 8 — Feature parity with The Lab + Hypeer Launcher (TBD)

> **[blocked]** on Phase 7. **NOT a UI/UX pass** (that is Phase 9) — this is a *feature* phase
> folding two existing companion tools into Yu'lon. Scope still TBD.

- [ ] **Identify "Hypeer Launcher"** — it is not referenced anywhere in this repo; determine what it is and which of its features (if any) belong in Yu'lon before planning
- [ ] **The Lab feature parity** (candidate list, to be confirmed when scoped): My Party (5-man bot group), item database + in-game mail, teleport, module management (parity with Yu'lon's existing applier), Steam integration, auto-shutdown on WoW close
- [ ] **Phase 8 exit criteria met** — TBD, to be defined after Phase 7 exits and Hypeer Launcher is identified/scoped

---

## Phase 9 — UI/UX pass for the v1 Alpha (TBD)

> **[blocked]** on Phase 8. **This IS the UI/UX pass** — polish the feature-complete app into a
> dad-friendly v1 Alpha. Scope TBD.

- [ ] **Phase 9 exit criteria met** — TBD; end state is a shippable v1 Alpha (all four v1 servers feature-complete + polished, consistent UI/UX on Linux, macOS, and native Windows)

## Cross-cutting

> Anything that doesn't cleanly belong to one phase — style-guide amendments, cross-document corrections, tooling gotchas, etc.
